## Example

# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
* text=auto

# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout.
#*.c text=lf # force linux line endings
#*.h text    # implies text=auto

# Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout.
*.sln text eol=crlf

# Ignore differences in files if its only line endings (shouldn't use this if working with others
# but rather set above options
* -crlf

# Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified.
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
